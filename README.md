Developed a comprehensive bank loan dashboard in Power BI, integrating in-depth analysis conducted using MSSQL. The dashboard aimed to present essential KPIs, such as total loan applications, total funded amounts, average interest rates, and average debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. These metrics were analyzed both month-to-date and on a month-on-month basis to track and visualize performance trends effectively.


The dynamic dashboard included visualizations that compared good versus bad loans, loan status breakdowns, and provided slicers for state-wise and grade-wise analysis. This detailed analysis revealed significant trends, such as an 11.8% higher bad loan rate among small businesses compared to the average, and over 50% higher bad loans for debt consolidation purposes. These insights helped identify high-risk areas and informed better loan management strategies.


The project empowered stakeholders by providing actionable insights that facilitated data-driven decision-making in loan management. The dashboard highlighted critical trends, enabling the development of targeted risk mitigation strategies and improved overall loan portfolio performance. This project demonstrated the value of integrating advanced data analytics with powerful visualization tools to enhance business intelligence and strategic planning.
